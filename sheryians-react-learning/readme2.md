- react is a library and next js is aa framework that indulge with the react 
- want to render in file use command (npx create-next-app)

- And nextjs is working for the both client and server side 
- client basically is the frontend parts i,e UI and server is the server side i,e UX
- have to import like "import client" 

- useState hooks is the variable of react
- useState[variableName, setVariableNameFunction] = (variableName Value);
- setVariableNameFunction is used to update the value 

- props is the basicalaly property, it is the passing data from parent to child

- routing means moving from one page to another
- (It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.)
- without relaoding

- why use routing ? => page reload naa ho 
- and in this case we are using link instead of using a tag
